               I work as a farm hand in all aspects of the job (Tractors, Animal Care, Feild, Structure, Maintence). 
               Have several years experience and am acustomed to working with others to accomplish the final goal. 
               This is where I learned the mentality of do a job right and do it fast.

            <p>
               I was hired as a delivery driver for the company, this is where I learned how to navigate a city, 
               and where my sence of direction comes from. Althogh I only worked there for a short time period
               I enjoyed working there with my crew.

            <p>
               I worked as a product inspector for the vinyl product made at the plant located in Nephi, UT.
               I directly reported to the head manager and not the shift manager. This is also where i learned how to drive a forklift.
               I learned here how to multitask 2 or 3 lines at once, work quickly, effectivly, and how to deal with those who do not share the 
               same work ethic as I do. The reason it is such a short time period is because I left for college.

                I work as a kitchen hand on the grill, fryers, and flatop broiler. 
                I work with a crew of 5 during the week, and I manage on the weekends.
                It is here I have learned how to help others understand what needs to be done in the work place.
                As well as work alongside them and show by example how things should be done.
